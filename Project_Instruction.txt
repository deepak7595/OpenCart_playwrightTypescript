For Project set up, refer the document. 
npm install @faker-js/faker ----> The package is to generate random testData. 
All the added dependencies will be available in "Package.json" file.
"test.config.ts" -> where we maintain all the urls and other reusable contents. {Global Test Data}


Scripts in Package.Json is completely customizable. 
we can create what combination we want. 

To run the script, npm playwright test "keywordfromScripts"



----- GIT -----

check document:

Follow the document, if the project is new...  1st approach.

for the first time, we create repository
git init --> we will be able to see "u" next to the file name.. which represent untracked files. 
git config --global user.name "deepak"   
git config --global user.email "johndeepak444@gmail.com"
git status -> show the files are in untracked
git add -A -> All files {or} git add filename -> if we plan to commit for single file. {or} git add *.ts --> means whatever file which has the extension as .ts. will be moved
{or} git add folderName --> means all file within the folder {or} git add . --> all files







if we work in existing project, then we have to clone the master --- 2nd approach
